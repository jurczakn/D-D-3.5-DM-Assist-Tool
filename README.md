# D-D-3.5-DM-Assist-Tool

Command line interface intended to assist with Dungeons and Dragons version 3.5.

Program allows user to create a character through simple walk through prompts, or
simply input an already finished character sheet.  Once players are inputed, a 
party can be created that can then be altered and can also be used to calculate
certain saving through.

NOTE:

-Does not yet support all default classes

-Saving functionality works, but loading characters does not.
